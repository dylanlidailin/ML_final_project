# DS 4021 Final Project

## Repository Contents

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on lung cancer classification. The project explores multiple classification algorithms (SVM, logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and KNN) to predict lung cancer outcomes. The repository includes data files, Jupyter notebooks for analysis and model development, and a final project report.
